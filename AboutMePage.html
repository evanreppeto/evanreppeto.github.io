        Hello, my name is Evan Reppeto and currently, I am a freshman attending Ohio 
        Dominican Univeristy. While here, I am a part of the Men's Soccer Team, and am 
        looking to recieve a major in computer science, and a minor in data science. My hometown is 
        South Lebanon, OH where I graduated from Kings High School, which is near Cincinnati. I'm very
        excited for what the future holds, and am looking forward to my time in college.

    <p class="AboutMeBody2"><font size ="+2">
        For most of life, I have been an advocate of exercise and athletics. 
        Since around the age of 4, I have been playing soccer and basketball. Never
        would I have imagined that I would be playing collegiate soccer today. When 
        I am not training or lifting for soccer, I usually find myself playing pick up basketball 
        or video games with my roommates or friends from home. On top that, I have a deep passion 
        with coding, and sometimes I will work on creating a bot, or doing something fun that could 
        be a way to make passive income.
